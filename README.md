# AirLine_Reservation_System

This is our semester project for Semester 3, where we created a simplified version of an airline reservation system. This project involved both frontend and backend development, and we used various technologies to bring it to life.

## Technologies Used

- React JS: We utilized React for building the frontend of our ticket booking system, allowing for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

- Express JS: Express was chosen for the backend development. It helped us create robust APIs and manage server-side logic efficiently.

- MySQL: We used MySQL as our database management system to store and manage flight data, reservations, and user information.

## Features

- User Authentication: Implemented a secure user authentication system to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their bookings.

- Flight Search: Provided users with the ability to search for available flights based on various criteria such as destination, date, and number of passengers.

- Booking Management: Users can view their bookings, make new reservations, and cancel existing ones.

- Admin Dashboard: Created an admin panel to manage flights, user accounts, and bookings.
